Repofinder is a simple web app that lists all of a given user's public repositories that are listed on Github. The app is built using JavaScript and jQuery, with use of the Github REST API.

## How It Works

Simply enter a username in the field below and hit search. The form fires off a query on submit to the Github API for all public repositories from that user. The names of the repositories are listed below as direct links to their respective pages.

Different messages will show if the user entered could not be found in the Github database or if the user has no public repositories.
